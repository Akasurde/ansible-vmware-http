# Ansible VMware Sample Playbooks for handling HTTP APIs


Following repos show how Ansible can be utilized to consume VMware HTTP APIs.

Requirements
------------

VMware HTTP APIs are supported in vCenter 6.5 and onwards. So, in order to use these playbooks you need to have vCenter version greater than equal to 6.5.

If you are going to use [Pyvmomi](https://github.com/vmware/pyvmomi) based (XMLRPC based) [modules](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/list_of_cloud_modules.html#vmware) then you need to install ``Pyvmomi`` using ``pip install pyvmomi``.


Examples
--------

Example Ansible playbook to manage VMware using HTTP APIs:

- [Get a list of all ESXi hosts available in the given datacenter](../get_all_hosts.yml)


Caveats
-------

Currently, these APIs are under development so not all features are available in vCenter server as a part of API.
